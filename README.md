### Project Title: Exploring Indian Tourism Data

## Overview:
Welcome to our GitHub repository for the project "Exploring Indian Tourism Data"! In this project, we delve into the fascinating realm of Indian tourism through data analysis. Our team, consisting of [Your Name], K.V.S. Tharani, and Akansha Shetty, embarked on this journey during our internship at Futurense Technologies and Jain (Deemed-to-be-University).

## Description:
Our project revolves around analyzing a comprehensive dataset on Indian tourism. We aimed to identify trends, patterns, and potential growth areas within the tourism sector. Through a blend of data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical techniques, we uncovered valuable insights into tourist arrivals, popular destinations, transportation preferences, and more.

## Key Highlights:

Identified a steady rise in tourist arrivals over the years, reflecting growing interest in India's culture and heritage.
Highlighted popular tourist destinations and areas with untapped potential for development.
Examined preferred transportation methods used by tourists, providing insights for infrastructure planning.
Project Structure:

## Data Cleaning: We started by cleaning and organizing the dataset to ensure its readiness for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We then conducted thorough data exploration, visualizing trends and patterns within the data.
Insights and Findings: Through visualization techniques and statistical analysis, we unveiled key insights into Indian tourism.
How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Access the dataset provided in the "data" directory.
Review the Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) to explore our data analysis process and findings.
